## How to Use This Document

This PRD serves as the main requirements reference for your project. When creating feature specifications:

1. **Reference PRD Sections:** Always include a "PRD References" section in your feature specs that links to relevant sections (e.g., "product-prd.md: 2.1, 3.1, 5.1")

2. **Maintain Traceability:** In your feature objectives, explicitly reference PRD sections to show how each feature supports the overall product vision

3. **Use Numbered Sections:** Follow the numbered section structure (1, 1.1, 1.2, etc.) for easy referencing

4. **Update as Needed:** Keep this document current as requirements evolve, and update feature specs accordingly
